CrossTire is an action-packed browser game based on the classic board game [Cross Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfire_(board_game)).

## Gameplay

The object of the game is to score points by knocking the tire into the opposing player's pit. Each player starts with 10 ball bearings which they can fire into the the game area for this purpose. When a ball bearing falls into a player's pit, that player recovers that bearing and adds it to his or her turret.

Place your left hand in the standard typing position and use the keys `E` and `F` to aim the turret up/down and `A`, `W`, or `S` to fire a ball bearing from the turret. Also, the game can be paused by using the `P` key.

The player can adjust the game volume and AI difficulty using the sliders to the right of the screen.

## Requirements

CrossTire requires an up to date web browser that supports the `range` input tag.
